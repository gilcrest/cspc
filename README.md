Go-centric Country, States, Province, County etc. information including lookup table DDL/DML for PostgreSQL

Please feel free to create issues to add to this library. This is US-Canada centric to start as that is the use case I am solving for currently, but can/should be expanded.

If you use one of the JSON array constants, know that all countries, states, provinces, counties ordering is by name.
